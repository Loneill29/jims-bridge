          <p class="lead p-0 justify">
            Even when school is not in session, Jim’s Bridge finds ways to help less fortunate children. This year, we were delighted to help fund a wonderful summer camp program sponsored by the Erie Neighborhood House. About 95 children, ages 5-12 attended summer camp at Camp Butternut Springs near Valparaiso, IN. This four day event included canoeing (many had never seen a canoe before), archery, arts & craft, fishing, frog hunting, capped by movies at night! Each child wore their personally tie-dyed shirt on the journey home. And they already want to go back next year! Click here to watch the video.

            The holidays can be a difficult time when you are unable to afford warm clothes or a small toy for the little ones. The mission of the Celebration of Giving is to provide children and families served by Catholic Charities and those in need with gifts and necessities during the holiday season. Celebration of Giving will touch the lives and bring joy to many families who may not have been able to celebrate the holidays.
            During their 2015 event, through the collection of donations from individuals, corporations and organizations, Catholic Charities distributed gifts and toys to more than 25,000 children and families.
